# helloworld

Command line steps to create a new app in:

[dotnet](./dotnet.md)

[go](./go.md)

[java](./java.md)

[node](./node.md)

[python](./python.md)

[react](./react.md)

Note: For languages with lots of dependencies, I prefer to use disposable environments like a virtual machine, container, GitHub codespaces, or windows subsystem for linux. This helps to keep your system clean, and when you want to swith to a different framework or version.
